projects:
  - name: "Fine-Tuned LLM Code Translator"
    description: "A causal language model that converts code from Python to JavaScript, focusing on idiomatic structure. Built with the Hugging Face Transformers library, tracked with TensorBoard."
    link: "https://github.com/DanielT504/FineTuned-LLM-Code-Translator"

  - name: "Deep-Learning Classifier for Insulator Defects"
    description: "A supervised Convolutional Neural Network using a pretrained Keras model and a TensorFlow backend to grade the hydrophobicity of preprocessed images of insulators with 99.6% accuracy."
    link: "https://github.com/DanielT504/deep-learning-defect-detection"

  - name: "Neural Network from Scratch"
    description: "A Self-Organizing Map with 90,000 neurons used to solve the traveling salesman problem. Implemented using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas."

achievements:
  - name: "Convolutional Neural Network for Remote Power Line Inspection"
    description: "Developed a CNN to evaluate the hydrophobicity of polymer insulators for remote power line inspections. Expanded a limited dataset by 23x using sequential augmentations, enabling training of a fine-tuned EfficientNet model for classification. Achieved accurate predictions on a scale of 1-6, with the model proving field-ready for web, mobile platforms, or drone deployment, in collaboration with a team handling hardware integration."

  - name: "Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Cross-Language Code Translation"
    description: "Enhanced cross-language compatibility by fine-tuning a GPT-2 LLM to translate Python code into JavaScript. Trained the model using the XLCoST library with 10% of 10,000 multilingual code snippets, optimized with HuggingFace AutoTokenizer and PyTorch. Despite hardware constraints, the model achieved near-perfect translations for trained function calls, showcasing potential for generalized code translation with minimal retraining."

  - name: "Optimizing Futex Locking with Red-Black Tree Implementation"
    description: "Improved system performance at Huawei by addressing inefficiencies in fast-userspace mutex (futex) lock handling. Migrated lock storage from hash buckets to a red-black tree, reducing worst-case wait time complexity to O(log n). This change resolved lock dequeuing inefficiencies, leading to more predictable and efficient system operations."
